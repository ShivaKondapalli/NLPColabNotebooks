# NLPColabNotebooks 

## Introduction  

Google colab notebooks for Natural Language Processing in Pytorch.

A notebook of Natural Language tasks. Google collaboratory offers *free gpu's* with a few limitations to truly leverage the power of 
Deep Learning models. Adding to that, Jupyter Notebooks are a fantastic medium of expostion that combine LateX style math formatting, pictures, 
MarkUp and code.

## 1. Classification_with_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_RNN_and_GRU.ipynb

This is the notebook version of the RNNClassification.py file hosted at [NLPPytorch](https://github.com/ShivaKondapalli/NLPPyTorch).

The notebook contains pedagogical information about RNN's and GRU's. Links to some really cool papers and indepth explanation of recurrent 
networks in both the vanilla and GRU manifestations. 

## 2. Classyfying_names_to_Gender_with_LSTM.ipynb

This is the Notebook version of LSTMClassification.py file hosted at [NLPPytorch](https://github.com/ShivaKondapalli/NLPPyTorch).

The data in this Notebook has been scraped from the web, the details of how to do so have been linked in the notebook. 

## 3. Text_Generation_with_LSTM.ipynb

This is the Notebook version of Generate_Text.py file hosted at [NLPPytorch](https://github.com/ShivaKondapalli/NLPPyTorch).

Contains an indepth explanation with Math, code and diagrams of Long Short Term memory networks.
